# funny-little-rerere-example-repo
I'm investigating git rerere and I've found I want to replicate the idea presented in https://stackoverflow.com/a/77453543 , which I feel is at odds with the details presented in https://stackoverflow.com/a/5519698

Anything I create for this project I place into the public domain. However, the code commits I'm going to make are from daiwai and since they're from stackoverflow they're CC BY-SA 4.0.

I'm using git version 2.46.2.windows.1
